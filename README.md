## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a critical task for real estate businesses, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions. This project leverages machine learning models to provide accurate predictions based on key features of houses such as size, location, and age.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about houses, including:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location
- Year built
- Other relevant features

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset and understand its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze data trends, missing values, and correlations.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and select the most relevant ones.
5. **Modeling**: Train and test multiple machine learning models.
6. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
7. **Deployment**: (Optional) Deploy the final model using a web app or API.
